    description: "Pleasantly new, and sometimes unexpected acquaintances are waiting for you. Open up your boundaries, and maybe you will become best friends with an amazing person with whom last year you would not even think of talking. It's unexpected as a friendship between Selena Gomez and Hiley Bieber, who would have known!",

    description: "Are you yearning for hype? It is waiting for you around the corner this new year. But be cautious – sometimes attracting too much attention to your product can make it the object of speculation and rumors. Or you can relax like Elon Musk does. He just enjoys it to the detriment of all haters. Be calm, like Elon.",

    description: "To rule the financial world – sounds like a superpower? It is, if we talk about Changpeng Zhao, who can control the market with the power of his tweets. You can do the same, maybe not on this scale – but we believe in you! Rule-wise, tweet wizer.",

    description: "\"Crissy wake up\" - bet you heard that mashup! Wake up, smile and do what you love! What is done with enthusiasm and fun always has the potential to become something more. Maybe even corn, a big lump with knodes. Schmoyoho proved this by creating hits from memes, or memes from hits. I can't imagine a more beautiful thing!",

    description: "Looking back, you may think it's too late to change anything. Nothing like that! Logan Paul proved the opposite, as well as possible. From a youtuber to a world MMA star. You can change the reality around you by believing in yourself and finding reliable like-minded people. The world is changing fast, which is not the time to stand still without moving.",

    description: "There are no unattainable heights, as there is always someone who has already been there or those who aspire to be there. It's a matter of time and effort. Just like Mr. Beast overtook PewDiePie in popularity, developing and improving the quality of his content. An inexhaustible source of new ideas and opportunities inside and around you. Use, believe and achieve. Ain't no 12M mountain high enough.",

    description: "You never know which project will bring you fame and recognition. The main thing is not to give up trying, they are not afraid to experiment and keep up with trends. Sydney Sweeney is a great example that by finding a promising project, you will open up new opportunities for development. Two Emmy nominations and your face on the cover of a famous magazine, are not bad prospects. The New Year will open up these opportunities for you, the main thing is to grab them with both hands.",

    description: "No matter how you feel about Cristiano Ronaldo, he is great. The footballer became the biggest influencer with 500 million followers. A large number of followers imposes great responsibility, it must be borne in mind that any action or statement will be spread by the media and people. Let it not be 500 million, but you also influence the people around you, so influence positively and the number of like-minded people around you will multiply.",

    description: "We are used to the fact that in pop culture, heroes wear masks. Also, some influencers achieve popularity by hiding their faces. For example, a gamer was hiding behind an ordinary hand-drawn smiley face, which did not prevent him from becoming the owner of two Guinness World Records and gathering a huge audience around him. He found the strength to show himself to the world, breaking his usual framework. It's a time for you to break the boundaries, surpass yourself, and show yourself to the world!",

    description: "Let popularity become your second skin. Bella showed it clearly by taking part in the Coperni show, dressed up in a dress made of a special spray. It was created right on top of her and it looked amazing. A simple white dress, but what a resonance. Of course, it's good if you're Bella, but this is relevant for everyone - don't push away popularity, be closer to it, that's the whole secret.",

    description: "Rivals on the field, friends in life. Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi met in a beautiful collaboration for Louis Vuitton to show that this is just a game. We should value our competitors because thanks to them we become stronger and wiser. Perhaps you should try to do something together with your opponent, no one expects this for sure!",

    description: "“Time is gone” – many try to justify that it's too late to start something new. It is wrong, just like the statement that tik-tok is only for zoomers. Rodger Cleye has shown that age is no barrier to becoming a tik-tok star. This year will be a turning point for you if you dare, and we will help you with this.",

    description: "No matter what you look like, you're always you. Let all the prejudices and patterns remain in the past year. Take an example from Heidi Klum, who, free from complexes, appeared before the audience in the form of a giant earthworm! No, we are not saying - dress in a strange costume and you will succeed right away, but it is definitely worth giving free rein to certain inner oddities!",

    description: "Friends will always help and support you. You can go crazy together as much as you want, but your friend will never turn away from you. Here is an example of two girlfriends, Brooke and Jessie, who are known as hoodie girls. They just danced synchronously in hoodies with a good, but at some point they became viral. Appreciate your friends!",

    description: "It's time to see the world, not only through the prism of a phone or computer screen. Does someone still watch TV? And we are not talking about traveling, but about a longer trip, like moving. The world of technology allows us to work from anywhere in the world, just like PewDiePie who moved to Japan! But the most interesting thing is that he hired a private plane for himself and his pugs. Isn't it cute!",

    description: "Next year, you will be on the wild side! Interpret it however you wish, but through the year we have been inspired by a real Tarzan, a guy named Kody Antle. His TikTok filled with wild nature and animals along his side. He is showing us life outside our boomtowns and comfortable flats, that you want to dive into the screen to get a cute hug from a white tiger. We believe you are born to be wild!",

    description: "Each of your advertising campaigns in the new year 2023 will be as kind and imbued with the same humor and mood as the pre-promo for the movie Deadpool 3, where Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, sitting in a cozy home atmosphere, told us about their reunion. It's worth learning from them how to erase the boundary between movie characters and reality.",

    description: "An unexpected and pleasant reunion with your old friends or colleagues awaits you, which can serve as the beginning of a new and productive project. Well, or you'll just have a great time, like the Spice Girls who decided to reunite at Ginger's birthday party! It was canonical!",
